# KaHaShEr
KaHaShEr is an application to check the integrity of a file using MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 checksum.
Designed to be smart and easy to use, it includes a feature that can detect a hexadecimal value in the clipboard and automatically perform the verification while notifying you with a very expressive sound of the outcome of this verification.
